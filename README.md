## **SQL-Alchemy-Homework**

The SQL Alchemy challenge consisted of two main parts:

--- 

### **Analyze Climate Data**

Part 1 of the challenge was concerned with the analysis of the climate data. Different data was queried to gain insights into the precipitation and temperatures in Hawaii. The different weather stations, specifically the most active one, was also analyzed in detail. 

--- 

### **Design Climate App**

The second section of the challenge consisted of the design of a climate app to provide access to the analyzed data. Different routes were created to show precipitation and temperature data in general. Lastly, the two final routes are more interactive. The user can enter a start or a start and an end date to determine a timeframe for which the minimum, maximum, and average temperature is then calculated.
